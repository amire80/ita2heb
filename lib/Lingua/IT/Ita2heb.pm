=head1 NAME

Lingua::IT::Ita2heb - transliterate Italian words into vocalized Hebrew.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Transliterate words in Italian into vocalized Hebrew.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Lingua::IT::Ita2heb;

    my $hebrew_word = Lingua::IT::Ita2heb::ita_to_heb('Castelmezzano');

=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 ita_to_heb

Given an Italian word, returns a vocalized Hebrew string.

Additional options:

=over

=item * disable_rafe

By default, the rafe sign will be added to the initial petter pe
if it represents an [f] sound. If you don't want it, run it like this:

    my $hebrew_word = Lingua::IT::Ita2heb::ita_to_heb('Firenze', disable_rafe => 1);

=item * disable_dagesh

By default, dagesh will be used wherever possible to
represent consonant gemination. If you don't want it, run it like this:

    my $hebrew_word = Lingua::IT::Ita2heb::ita_to_heb('Palazzo', disable_dagesh => 1);

=item * ascii_geresh

By default, Unicode HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERESH is used to indicate
the sounds of ci and gi. If you want to use the ASCII apostrophe, run it like this:

    my $hebrew_word = Lingua::IT::Ita2heb::ita_to_heb('Cicerone', ascii_geresh => 1);

=item * ascii_maqaf

By default, Unicode HEBREW PUNCTUATION MAQAF is used to indicate
the hyphen. This is the true Hebrew hyphen at the top of the line.
If you prefer to use the ASCII hyphen (minus), run it like this:

    my $hebrew_word = Lingua::IT::Ita2heb::ita_to_heb('Emilia-Romagna', ascii_maqaf => 1);

=back

=head2 closed_syllable

Checks that the vowel is in a closed syllable.

Arguments: a reference to a list of characters and
the index of the vowel to check.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item * Unknown letter LETTER in the source

The LETTER doesn't look like a part of the Italian orthography.

=back

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This program has several known limitations because Italian pronunciation is
sometimes unpredictable and because of the quirks of Hebrew spelling. Do
not assume that transliterations that this program makes are correct
and always check a reliable dictionary to be sure. Look out especially for
the following cases:

=over

=item * Words with of z

The letter z is assumed to have the sound of [dz] in the beginning of
the word and [ts] elsewhere. This is right most of the time, but there are
also many words where it is wrong.

=item * Words with ia, ie, io, iu

The letter i is assumed to be a semi-vowel before most of the time,
but there are also many words where it is wrong.

=item * Words with accented vowels

This program treats all accented vowels equally. Accents are usually
relevant only for indicating stress, which is hardly ever marked in Hebrew,
but in some words they may affect pronunciation.

=item * Segol is always used for the sound of e

One day this program may become more clever one day and use tsere and segol
in a way that is closer to standard Hebrew vocalization. Until then... well,
very few people will notice anyway :)
